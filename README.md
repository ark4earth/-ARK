- 👋 Hi, I’m @ark4earth
- 👀 I’m interested in the studies on literature and environment that relate with other discursive fields like Science, ecology, Religion, and Spirituality
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about practical applicability of environmental thought through a study of ecological writings and literature as well as how to bring about sustainable change in the society and the world.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a paper Eco-Spirituality and Material Eco-criticism: Spirit, Matter and Ecology
- 📫 How to reach me ...
